I used this monstrosity back in 2006 when I was spending a lot of time
studying XSLT. For a while I thought it was pretty sweet, but eventually
regained my senses and started using xsltproc and Saxon from CLI.

I'm keeping it here strictly for sentimental value, use at your own risk.

Very likely it isn't going to work anywhere but in Gecko/SpiderMonkey-
based browsers.

Only matching pairs of .xml and .xsl files from the xsl/ sub-directory
are listed in the UI. XML and XSL buttons display the corresponding
files, while the ">" button runs the transformation and attempts to
display the result. A couple of trivial examples are provided by way of,
well, example.

The file cf/xslkit.cf.xml contains some configuration options, including
a number of very silly ones.
